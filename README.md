- Please download FaceNet pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVSTgxX25ZQzNTMGc/view), extract and put it in ```repo_root_dir/pretrained_models/FaceNet/```
- you can add image files to ```repo_root_dir/data/images/``` and try out ```test_FaceRecognizer.py```
- FaceRecognizer API documentation can be found in file ```FaceRecognizer.py``` --> you only need to look at FaceRecognizer class, not need to look at FaceDatabase class, for external usage
